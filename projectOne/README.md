Mile Stone One:

Overall description of the project:
    I would like to make a website that uses anime.js to illustrate recipes to a user through the use of scrolly-telling. The website would aim to make simple recipes even simpler, the intended audience would be children, or people that are very new to cooking and want to experiment with super easy recipes. One inspiration that I had for this project is [Atmos](https://atmos.leeroy.ca), I really like how as you scroll the airplane flies through different facts.I thought that it was a super inventive way to format a website.

Description of how you intend to use JavaScript to significantly enhance the user experience of your website:
    Using Anime.js to make simple illustrations move as you scroll. This would require event listeners for scroll. I would also like to have a drop down to have users pick from a few different recipes.

Description of which new-to-you JavaScript library or 3rd party API you intend to you, and what you intend to use it for:
    Anime.js is the new-to-me library that I would like to use for this project and I intend on using it for animating shapes and images alongside scroll.

Any content or information sources you intend to draw upon, start thinking about them early and include them in the proposal if possible:
    Sources of information I might pull from are online recipes. I have not sorted out which recipes I am going to include yet, but I will cite any recipes that I use.

Describe or show how you intend to make the website responsive to different screen sizes and environments:
    I plan on using window.matchMedia() in the javascript, I will check if a window has been resized and if so I will resize the content. 

Your goals for the project should be split up by what you think are goals for:
    
    Prototyping/proof of concept:
        Drop down menue to select recipie as well as unanimated recipies layed out in scroll friendly format

    MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
        Three simple recepies, with abstracted illustration (2d primitive shapes)

    Stretch goals:
        Five recepies, More advanced illustrations such has custom drawings for each recipe

Up to now I have focused my efforts on designing the layout of my website and learning the basics of Anime.js. Through learning figma I have created a "high fidelity" mock up of my webpage that resembles what I would like my page to look like.

I have also been learning about how to install and animate using Anime.js. For my project most of the animation will be done through scrolling. In order to accomplish this I think I am going to time amount my animations to the scroll percents of the page, as long as I am easily able to animate based on user scroll the project should ocme together nicely. Below is a link to some test animation I created using Anime.js.

Finally, one thing I have decided to change about my project is the scope. Instead of having my MVP be three recipes I think I will start with one and focus on rendering better animations. My stretch goal will then be three recipes that users can pick from. I decided that the most tedious part of the project is going to be all the illustraitions and limiting this should give me a lot more time to focus on whats important.
